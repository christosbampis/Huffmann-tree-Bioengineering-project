Huffmann-tree-Bioenginerring-project
====================================

Huffmann tree - Bioenginerring project

This project is related to lossless compression techniques. As part of a simple implementation
an ECG signal is being compressed by using the probability of each symbol (which is a voltage
amplitude value) as it is expressed through the occurency frequency in the same signal. After
the creation of Huffmann tree, both procedures, encoding and decoding are being carried out and
each symbol is then matched to its original one without losing data. There is only a quantization
step in the beginning in order to create a Huffmann alphabet.

Note 1 : full code has been uploaded. Download ecg.mat from http://www.filedropper.com/ecg,
run main.m and check the results file.

Note 2 : A report in this project is also available in Greek (send email). More diagrams are available there
explaining the implementation and the theoretical background.
